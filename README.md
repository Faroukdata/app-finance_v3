# Finance Labs ðŸ“ˆ - HEC Paris

This repository contains code for the **Finance Labs** ðŸ“ˆ streamlit app developed by **Hi! PARIS** for HEC Paris.<br>
The app contains two practical labs where students in groups have to answer portfolio theory questions, based on the stocks selected.
- Lab 1: One risky and one risk-free asset
- Lab 2: Two risky assets

Four versions on the app were deployed to Streamlit Cloud, one for each professor. <br>
Each app has its own main code file (`app_irina.py`, `app_francois.py`, `app_daniel.py`, `app_quirin.py`). <br>
Labs/exercices are found in `labs/`.
